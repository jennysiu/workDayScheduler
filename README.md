## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application designed for individuals with busy schedules. Built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, this app is a perfect tool for daily planning and time management. It leverages the Day.js library to handle dates and times, offering a user-friendly interface to add and manage events throughout a standard business day.


## Features

### Current Day Display
Upon opening the planner, users are greeted with the current day displayed prominently at the top of the calendar. This feature helps in keeping track of the day's date and planning accordingly.

### Time Blocks for Business Hours
The scheduler presents a clear view of the standard business hours, broken down into hourly time blocks. This layout simplifies the process of scheduling tasks and meetings throughout the workday.

### Color-Coded Time Blocks
To enhance usability and provide a visual cue, each time block is color-coded. The colors indicate whether a time slot is in the past, present, or future, making it easy to identify the current time and upcoming events.

### Interactive Event Entry
Users can click on any time block to enter details of an event or task. This interactive feature makes adding and modifying events a seamless experience.


### Data Persistence
The scheduler is designed to retain and display the saved events even after the browser or tab is closed and reopened. This way your saved events are still there even if you accidentally close the tab or need it for later.

### Clear All Events
Option to clear all events so that you can start with a clean slate again.
